This was my first ever personal project, done as part of the Boot.dev course. 

I ended up relying a LOT on chat gpt to help with my code here, but thanks to that I was able to practice a lot of concepts - thinking about level design,
difficulty, project scope, code consistency, debugging, pushing and pulling from git hub. I'm sure these are all very basic things to anyone with
experience, but I really had my first opportunity here to experience them for myself.

Project Scope - this was probably the biggest thing I noticed. This project really got out of hand for me, and it made it very hard to complete. I kept wanting to
add more features, but the more I added the longer it felt it was taking to finish, and the harder it was to fit everything into my 40 hour time limit for
the project. In the end, I'm happy with what I got, but if I were to do it all over again, there are absolutely things I would prioritize harder, and things
I initialized but never ended up using that could be cut.
