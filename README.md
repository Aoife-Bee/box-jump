This was my first ever personal project, done as part of the Boot.dev course, but entirely self directed.

I ended up relying a LOT on chat gpt to help with my code here, more than I'm happy with honestly, because my writing fundamentals are still very under-practiced.
But, thanks to the help I had with writing the code, I was able to practice a lot of other concepts - thinking about level design, difficulty, project scope, 
code consistency, debugging, pushing and pulling from git hub. I'm sure these are all very basic things to anyone with experience, but I really had my first 
opportunity here to experience them for myself.

Project Scope - this was probably the biggest thing I noticed. This project really got out of hand for me, and it made it very hard to complete. I kept wanting to
add more features, but the more I added the longer it felt it was taking to finish, and the harder it was to fit everything into my 40 hour time limit for
the project. In the end, I'm happy with what I got, but if I were to do it all over again, there are absolutely things I would prioritize harder, and things
I initialized but never ended up using that could be cut.

Level Design - I tried to think a lot about this, but as my time limit drew to a close I made a lot of sacrifices in the final stretch of the game here.
BUT, I put a lot of thought into the first 2 levels from a design perspective - making jumps specific heights to teach the player subconsciously what the limits
of the movement are, having my first level not punish mistakes with damage but just with having to do the jumps again, introducing damage in my 2nd level and 
easing the player into the death mechanic, and throughout all of my levels I spent a lot of time thinking about the atmosphere and the visuals as well. Given my 
limited ability to make visuals for the game, I actually think it looks quite pretty.

Refactoring - This is something I WISH I had more time to practice. I did invest a not insignificant amount of time into simplifying parts of my code, making
things less complicated or structuring things in an organized manner, but again, I simply ran out of time here to really do as much of this as I wanted to.
